They are the characteristics and processes we consider worthy.\n        Values are expressed by how we behave now, and how we intend to behave on a daily basis, as we live in community.\n        \n        For example:\n        sustainability, fairness, kindness, generosity, service, accessibility, thrift, conservation of resources\n                \n        Goals (objectives)\n        Those are milestones we commit to reach and they are short term.
